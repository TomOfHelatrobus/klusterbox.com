            <h3>Klusterbox for Mac</h3>
            <p>Klusterbox for Mac OS works the same way as Klusterbox for Windows, although the look and feel and
            the file management is a bit different. The installation process simplier. </p>

            <p>I recommend against using Apple Numbers (the Mac spreadsheet
            app). Klusterbox spreadsheets are based off of the xlsx file format (from Microsoft Excel) which isn't
            completely compatable with Numbers although it will work. I recommend downloading Libre Office from
            <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org">libreoffice.org</a>.It has a spreadsheet program called Calc, which I used
            to develop all the spreadsheets. It's free. Then change the default program for xlsx files
            with the following steps: 1.Right-click on an Excel File (. xlsx), 2.Click on Get Info in the pop-up.
            3. Click Open With if the section isn't already expanded. 4.Click the dropdown and choose LibreOffice
            Calc. 5. Click Change All... 6. Click Continue when the Finder asks you if you're sure. This way,
            LibreOffice Calc will always be used to open your xlsx files.</p>

            <p><b>Installation Problems: </b>
            Once Klusterbox is in the Applications Folder you might get an error when you click on the app
            preventing you from opening it. The error identifies the app as being from an unidentified developer.
            I guess that's because I don't want to pay Apple $99/year to get an Apple Developer ID.
            To get around this problem, you can click on the Apple icon, select System Preferences,
            select Security and Privacy, select the General tab. Select "Allow apps downloaded from: App
            Store and unidentified developers" if it is available. If not click on the lock icon and you might be given
            an option to allow Klusterbox. If you still have issues, this issue is addressed from
            <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-a-mac-app-from-an-unidentified-developer-mh40616/mac">
                apple support</a>, click on the link for more information.</p>
            <p>An alternate work around from
            <a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/open-an-app-by-overriding-security-settings-mh40617/11.0/mac/11.0">
            apple support</a> is to: <br>1. In the Finder on your Mac, locate the app you want to open.
            Most apps can be found in the Applications folder. <br>
            2. Control-click the app icon, then choose Open from the shortcut menu. <br>
            3.Click Open. <br>
            4. The app is saved as an exception to your security settings, and you can open it in the future by
            double-clicking it, just as you can any authorized app.</p>

        <h3>Klusterbox Installer for Windows</h3><p>It's been a long time coming, but Klusterbox finally has an installer
            available for Windows. You just download the Setup_klusterbox.exe from this page (click the green download
            link below), open your downloads
            folder and double click on the icon. There will be no kb_sub folder to keep track of and no zip file to
            unzip like on version 3
            and earlier versions of Klusterbox. You launch the program from the start menu, just like a normal program.
            Also a shortcut will be generated on your desktop, though you can delete that if you don't want it. </p>

            <p><b>Installation Problems: </b>
            You might get blocked from Windows Defender when first running Klusterbox. To get around this, click the
            "More Info" link in the blue dialog that pops up, then press "Run Anyway". Now the program should run. This
            website is secure and I am the only person uploading klusterbox distributions to this page. So long as
            you get your klusterbox distribution from this page, it should be virus free.</p>

            <h3> Legacy Klusterbox for Windows</h3>
            <p>Please keep in mind that the file you download contains an executable file.
            It will run without needing to be setup. This bears repeating, there is no setup. Just download the file,
                move it to where you want it(I keep mine in my Documents file and NOT in my Program Files) then unzip
                the file and then click on the exe file it to start
                it. You might want to create a shortcut for your
            desktop, but that is up to you. It is important to keep the klusterbox.exe file and the kb_sub folder in the
                same folder. All of this should be covered in the install tutorial.</p>
            <p>I'm making two versions available, both for Windows. One will be the 64 bit version and the second is the
        32 bit version. Which one you install depend on what kind of computer you have. If you don't know if you computer
        is 64 or 32 bit, then you should download the 32 bit version - that should work regardless of what kind of
        system type you have.</p>
