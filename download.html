            <h3>Klusterbox for Mac</h3><p>Finally Klusterbox is available for mac. The set up is a bit different than
            the set up for windows. You download the zip file from this page. Unzip the folder in the Downloads folder
            which unzips to show the app. Then you drag and drop the app into the Applications folder. It
            appears in Launch Pad and you run it like a normal app. Their is no kb_sub folder like on the windows
            version. When there is an upgrade, you can just delete you're old version of Klusterbox and drag and drop
            the new one into the Applications folder. You will not lose any information because the database is kept
            outside of the app bundle in a hidden folder: /Documents/.klusterbox/mandates.sqlite.</p>

            <p>The look and feel have been updated to compliment mac OS. The spreadsheets have been modified to work in
            Apple Numbers, the Mac spreadsheet app as well as Microsoft Excel and Libre Office Calc. Any documents or
            reports in the klusterbox archives are stored in the /Documents/klusterbox folder for easy access. </p>

            <p>Long story short, the mac version should be simpler and easier to use. </p>

            <p><b>Installation Problems: </b>
                Once Klusterbox is in the Applications Folder you might get an error when you click on the app
                preventing you from openning it. The error identifies the app as being from an unidentified developer.
                I guess
            that because Mac OS doesn't know who I am. To get around this problem, you can click on the Apple icon,
            select Security and Privacy, select the General tab. Select "Allow apps downloaded from: App Store and
            unidentified developers" if it is available. If not click on the lock icon and you might be given an option
            to allow Klusterbox. If you still have issues, this issue is addressed from

            <h3>Klusterbox for Windows</h3>
            <p>Please keep in mind that the file you download contains an executable file.
            It will run without needing to be setup. This bears repeating, there is no setup. Just download the file,
                move it to where you want it(I keep mine in my Documents file and NOT in my Program Files) then unzip
                the file and then click on the exe file it to start
                it. You might want to create a shortcut for your
            desktop, but that is up to you. It is important to keep the klusterbox.exe file and the kb_sub folder in the
                same folder. All of this should be covered in the install tutorial.</p>
            <p>I'm making two versions available, both for Windows. One will be the 64 bit version and the second is the
        32 bit version. Which one you install depend on what kind of computer you have. If you don't know if you computer
        is 64 or 32 bit, then you should download the 32 bit version - that should work regardless of what kind of
        system type you have.</p>

            <h3>Klusterbox for Linux</h3>
            <p>And I'll get around to a Linux distribution sooner or later. I started at one
            point, but quit considering I had other problems to work on. I think I've developed some skills in working
            on the mac version that should come in handy tackling Linux. If you are tech saavy and know python, feel
            free to give it a try. Klusterbox is licensed in such a way that you are free to modify it. There is
            information on the repo on github at the bottom of the page also, you can download the python source code
            on this page.</p>
