    <td width="600" colspan="3">
      <p>In the most recent version, I've expanded Klusterbox to allow route numbers over 99 and ptf are allowed as a
      list type. Moreover, these changes are reflected in the Automatic Data Entry. PTFs will appear in the Improper
      Mandates spreadsheet as Auxiliary carriers. Also, I've added Database Maintenance tools to help you keep your
      database clean and to help you know what is in it. </p>
      <p>In version 4.0, finally Klusterbox has an installer.
      You can start up Klusterbox from the start menu and you no longer have to keep track of the kb_sub folder which
      was an issue in version 3 and earlier. It's like a REAL program now. If you don't like it, Klusterbox has an
      uninstaller - just uninstall it like a regular program. </p>
      <p>In version 3.008, I've developed a Mac compatable version of klusterbox. This works like a proper
      app which is placed in the Applications Folder can be accessed from Launch Pad (that's an upgrade from the
        Windows version). This was more work that I was
      expecting and I had to make a good deal of modifications but I did learn a lot. </p>
      <p>In version 3.007, I'm working to improve the pdf converter which converters
        employee everything
      reports in pdf format to csv format. Klusterbox can read csv formatted employee everything reports and allow you
      to skip the hours needed to enter in those carrier rings. Extracting data from pdf files is like pulling teeth,
      so there have been a lot of bugs along the way, but I think this is the best version so far and I'm hoping
      I've solved the problem.
      <br>
      I'm starting on a series of reports which open in notepad. So far I've got carrier
      routes and ns days, but future versions will have a lot more such as OTDL equitability and distribution of
      overtime for carriers not on the OTDL. </p></td>
