      <p>In the most recent version, I've added SpeedSheets which allow a steward to manually enter carrier list and
      clock rings in the fastest way possible. I'm not sure how intuitive the process will be, so be sure to turn
      in for tutorials to get the most out of this new feature. I've also done a lot of work behind the scenes to
      make klusterbox a better program.</p>
      <p>In version 4.001, I've expanded Klusterbox to allow route numbers over 99 and ptf are allowed as a
      list type. Moreover, these changes are reflected in the Automatic Data Entry. PTFs will appear in the Improper
      Mandates spreadsheet as Auxiliary carriers. Also, I've added Database Maintenance tools to help you keep your
      database clean and to help you know what is in it. </p>
      <p>In version 4.0, finally Klusterbox has an installer.
      You can start up Klusterbox from the start menu and you no longer have to keep track of the kb_sub folder which
      was an issue in version 3 and earlier. It's like a REAL program now. If you don't like it, Klusterbox has an
      uninstaller - just uninstall it like a regular program. </p>
      <p>In version 3.008, I've developed a Mac compatable version of klusterbox. This works like a proper
      app which is placed in the Applications Folder can be accessed from Launch Pad (that's an upgrade from the
        Windows version). This was more work that I was
      expecting and I had to make a good deal of modifications but I did learn a lot. </p>
