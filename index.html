      <p>In 2019, I started learning python and building this program. It's been a journey, a lot of work and
      a lot of fun. I set out to make the program that I wished had been available to me. By that time I had spent
      dozens of hours manually typing in clock rings on my custom-made improper mandate spreadsheet. I knew there
      had to be an easier way. Bit by bit I developed the program starting with core functionality and piling on
      new features, bells and whistles such as automatic data entry and the pdf converter, but it wasn't until I got
      an installer that I started to feel like it was a real program. I also expanded the program for use in stations
      which were dissimilar to mine (different ns days, route numbers, etc.) based on feed back from other stewards.
      </p>
      <p>The program is available for free for any steward who wants to use it. I haven't asked for any money because
      there aren't many expenses - mostly the cost of server space for the website which I develop and maintain
      myself. The software is open source because I want users to feel assured that there is no scam or racket going
      on here, not even a profit motive. I have invested quite a bit of time, hundreds of hours. To be honest, I didn't
      think it would take quite so much time, but programing is complex and I kept thinking of new features to add.
      Also, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't pissed off about all the contractual violations.  If you share that
      sentiment and have a penchant for technical solutions, then I've got a app for you. </p>
      <p>Happy Union Stewarding!</p>
