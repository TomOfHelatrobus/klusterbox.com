<h2>Building Carrier List</h2>
<p>A carrier list is a list of carriers that are relevant to your
investigation. The carrier list can vary week to week, day to day and
will certainly differ from one station to another station. The
carriers on the carrier list will either be full time regulars or
auxiliary carriers (CCAs). Each carrier on the carrier list will be
defined by combination of attributes:
<table>
    <tr><td valign="top">1.</td><td>Effective Date (Since there can be more
        than one record for any one carrier, the effective date is the date
upon which this carrier&rsquo;s particular status becomes effective) </td></tr>
    <tr><td valign="top">2.</td><td> Name</td></tr>
    <tr><td valign="top">3.</td><td>List Status (that is if the carrier is on the overtime desired list,
work assignment list or no list. Auxiliary or &ldquo;aux&rdquo; is
also a list status for the purposes of Klusterbox)</td></tr>
    <tr><td valign="top">4.</td><td> NS Day (this
is the carrier&rsquo;s non scheduled day. It can be expressed as a
color or a day of the week as Klusterbox, given the service week
knows the correct ns day for each ns day color code) </td></tr>
    <tr><td valign="top">5.</td><td>Route (For
regular carriers this will be one route expressed as four digits. In
the case of carrier technicians, floaters  or T6s, it should be
expressed as five routes, expressed as four digits each, separated by a
backslash. For auxiliary carriers the field should be left blank).</td></tr>
    <tr><td></td><td></td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Using the Automatic Data Entry</h3>
<p>If you have the correctly formatted documentation, you can use the
Automatic Data Entry to build the Carrier List. For more
information on this see How to Use the Automatic Data Entry.
This will automate much of the process and should cut down on the
time needed considerably.   
</p>
<p>


</p>
<h3>Entering in New Carriers Manually</h3>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have the correctly formatted documentation then
you can still build the Carrier List manually. Once you have entered
a carrier into Klusterbox, they will be added to the database and you
will not need to add them again for future investigations. 
</p>
<a name="new_carrier"></a>
<h3>Entering New Carrier Information</h3>
<p>Once you have entered in an Investigation Range (see Getting
Started if you don&rsquo;t know how)  a panel of buttons should
appear on the bottom of the main screen. The first of these buttons
will be the &ldquo;New Carrier&rdquo; button. To enter a new carrier
to the carrier list, press this button. You will need to do this for
each new carrier that you want to add. 
</p>

</img>
You
can also access the New Carrier function via the menubar with the
path Basic &gt; New Carrier. 
</p>
<p>The effective date is the date on which the carrier and the
particular list of attributes given, becomes effective. <b>To set the
effective date</b> you will use the option menus to set the month and
day. Then you will use the text field to enter the year. This works
the same as setting the Investigation Range. Since the effective date
is already set to the first day of the Investigation Range, you
shouldn&rsquo;t have to make any changes, but it is important that
you set the correct Investigation Range ahead of time &ndash; to be
clear, this is the date or range of dates that you are investigating.

</p>
<p><b>To set the carrier name</b> you will use the text fields under
last name and first initial. It is recommend that you enter only one
first initial although you can add a full first name if you like or
need to. Since the Klusterbox database uses the carrier name as a
unique identifier, you might have to add a full first name so as to
differ individuals with the same last name and the same first
initial.  
</p>
<p>Please note that even if you use a mixture of upper case and lower
case in when entering in the carrier name, the name will be saved as
all lower case and will be displayed as such thereafter. 
</p>

</p>
<p><b>To set the list status</b> you need to select from a list of
four radial buttons. The options are &ldquo;OTDL&rdquo; for overtime
desired list, &ldquo;Work Assignment&rdquo; for work assignment list,
&ldquo;No List&rdquo; if the carrier is not on a list and &ldquo;Auxiliary&rdquo; for
auxiliary carriers such as City Carrier Assistants.  The default
setting is No List.

</p>
<p><b>To set the n</b><b>on scheduled</b> day click on one of the
buttons under the &ldquo;non scheduled day&rdquo; heading. The
buttons show both an abbreviated day of the week which correlates to
the carriers ns day color code as well as the color code. Also, when
pressed, the button will light up with the color of the ns day color
code. The default is &ldquo;none.&rdquo; 
</p>
<p><img src="images/6-0050.jpg">

</img>
<br/>
</p>
<p><b>T</b><b>o set the route/s</b> use the text field to enter in
the carrier route. Routes are expressed as 4 digits. The first two
digits are the last two digits of the zip code or zone. The last two
digits are the route number. If the carrier is an auxiliary carrier,
there will be no route. Even though an auxiliary carrier might have
opted a route, the &ldquo;route&rdquo; attribute does not relate to
opted routes. In the case of carrier technicians, floaters and T-6s
there is a very specific format for entering in the string of routes.
It consist of five 4 digit routes separated by backslashes. For
example &ldquo;0901/0905/0915/0924/1251&rdquo;. Having the routes in
the correct format will help the Automatic Data Entry to
identify work done off route automatically. Note that the routes
don&rsquo;t have to be in any numerical order.

</p>
<p><b>To set the station</b> you really don&rsquo;t have to do
anything because the correct station matches the station set in the
Investigation Range and is set as the default. If, for some reason,
you need to select a different  station or &ldquo;out of station&rdquo;
you can use the option menu.

</p>
<p>Pressing &ldquo;Go Back&rdquo; will result in cancellation. The
screen will close and main screen will appear without the new carrier
being added. <b>To apply</b> and add the new carrier to the carrier
list, press the &ldquo;Apply&rdquo; button on the bottom of the
screen once you have entered all the correct information. 
</p>
<p>Once you have applied the changes, the new carrier screen will
close and the main screen will appear.  Any new carriers will also
appear on the carrier list. If you see anything amiss with the new
carrier&rsquo;s attributes you can make changes with the edit button.
