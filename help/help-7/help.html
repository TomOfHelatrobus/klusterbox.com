<h2>Editing Carrier Information</h2>
<p>To make any changes in a specific carrier's information, you can use the "edit" button. This will be the case
	whatever you are changing whether it is the carrier's name, list status, route, etc. In the main screen,
	with the investigation range set, select the "edit" button next the name that you want to change.</p>
	<br><br>

  	<br><br>
	<h3>The Time Dimension for Carrier Information</h3>
	<p>Since a carrier's attributes such as their route, list status, ns day and station changes over time,
	Klusterbox creates multiple records for carriers depending on the date. Klusterbox records and keeps this information
	so that different investigations from different time periods will be accurate. If a carrier gets on the OTDL
	in October, but gets off the OTDL on November 6, Klusterbox can record this and reflect this information in the
	investigations for October and November, both before and after the 6th, even if the 8th is in the middle
	of the week. To make this possible, all
	records will have an "effective date". It is shown as the first thing on the top of the screen when you press
	the "edit" button to update a carrier's information. When you press edit, the Edit Carrier Information screen
	defaults to show the </p>
	<a name="changing_name"></a>
	<h3>Changing a name</h3>
	<p>A screen titled "Edit Carrier Information" will appear. Edit/update the name in the field under "carrier name:"
	You can change the first name, last name or both. <b>Note:</b> The name attibute is the only attribute which is changed without
	regard to a particular time. For example: if you change the carrier's name in 2019, all previous instances of that
	name will be change for dates prior to 2019.  </p>

	<br><br>
	<p><b>Possible Error: Entering a name which is already being used.</b>If you enter a name which is already being
		used, you will get an error message as shown below. In this example a name is entered and the update button
		is pressed.</p>
	<br><br>
	<img src="images/help-7-0030.jpg">
	<br><br>
  	<p>A messagebox will appear to ask you if you want to make the changes. Press OK or cancel.</p>
	<br><br><img src="images/help-7-0040.jpg">
	<p>In this case, the name you have selected is already being used by another carrier. You will be notified
	with a messgebox showing a warning. You will not be permitted to make this name change. You will have to
	change the name to something different.</p>
	<br><br>
	<img src="images/help-7-0050.jpg">
	<br><br>
	<p><b>Proceeding Without Errors: </b> Make changes to the name field. Make sure the name is changed to a unique name,
		unlike any other name which is already in the system. Once finished, press the Update button .</p>
	<br><br>
	<img src="images/help-7-0060.jpg">
	<br><br>
	<p>A messagebox will appear asking if you are sure. Press "OK" to finalize the changes. </p>
	<br><br>
	<img src="images/help-7-0070.jpg">
	<br><br>
	<p>The carrier list will refresh to show the updated name. Here you can see it on line #4. The name change
		is complete</p>

	<p>8 d. A window will open showing you the extracted
	files. To open Klusterbox, click on the application
	&ldquo;Klusterbox.&rdquo; This is how you will open
	Klusterbox from now on. Klusterbox does not appear on
	the start menu (maybe in future versions, but not
	now). The kb_sub folder contains files that
	Klusterbox needs to work properly. Make sure to not
	delete it and to keep it in the same folder as the
	Klusterbox app to ensure the program works correctly.</p>
<br><br>
<img src="images/help-1-0090.jpg">
<br><br>
	<p>8 e. <b>Create a shortcut: </b>If
	you want to make accessing Klusterbox a little easier
	by creating a shortcut, then right click on the
	Klusterbox file. Select &ldquo;Create Shortcut&rdquo;
	on the menu. This will create a shortcut that you can
	drag to your Desktop for easy access.
	</p>
	<p>9. (Optional) If you want to be sure that the
	program doesn&rsquo;t contain a virus, visit
	<a href="http://www.virustotal.com/">www.virustotal.com</a>
	and upload the Klusterbox file. The site scans
	whatever is uploaded to it with all the commercially
	available antivirus software programs. Klusterbox
	version 2 comes up clean in 70 different anti-virus
	programs &ndash; except for one false positive (just
	my luck) from an anti-virus I&rsquo;ve never heard of
	Jiangmin
	which doesn&rsquo;t respond when you report false
	positives.</p>
	<p>If you have an anti-virus installed on your
	computer (I have Avast), you can right click on the
	klusterbox file and select &ldquo;Scan selected items
	for viruses.&rdquo; Even if you don&rsquo;t take this
	step, the anti-virus should scan any executable file
	the first time you start it anyway.
	</p>
	<p>10. Since this is the first time starting this
	program and because Windows doesn&rsquo;t know that
	Klusterbox exist, you will get a warning from
	Windows.</p>
<br><br>
<img src="images/help-1-0100.jpg">
<br><br>
	<p>
	If you get this prompt, click on the &ldquo;More info&rdquo;
	link. Only after that will you get the option to &ldquo;Run
	Anyway.&rdquo; Please press, &ldquo;Run Anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<br><br>
<img src="images/help-1-0110.jpg">
<br><br>
	<p>11. Klusterbox should now open unless you have issues
	with Anti-Viruses. It that happens, see the section
	below called Anti-Virus Programs.
	</p>
	<a name="antivirus_problems"></a>
	<h3>Anti-Virus Program Problems</h3>
	<p>There might be an issue with anti-virus programs.
	This was an issue with Klusterbox version 1.0, but
	not too much of a problem. I have Avast Anti-Virus.
	So the following will detail the conflicts that Avast
	has with Klusterbox and will show how to get things
	working properly. I don&rsquo;t know how other
	anti-virus programs are going to interact with
	Klusterbox, but hopefully, this description will give
	you an idea of how to handle them.
	</p>
	<p>First, the anti-virus program scans Klusterbox as
	the program is trying to open.
	</p>
<br><br>
<img src="images/help-1-0120.jpg">
<br><br>
	<p>Once the scan is completed, a message will appear stating
	that no viruses were found. This appeared and
	disappeared before I could get a screen shot of it.
	</p>
	<p>The next thing to happen is a prompt appears with
	an error message and Klusterbox shuts down. This
	looks pretty grim.
	</p>
<br><br>
<img src="images/help-1-0130.jpg">
<br><br>>
	<p>Immediately after that another prompt from Avast stating that
	Avast has stopped Klusterbox from writing to a
	document called Mandates.SQLITE. Mandates.SQLITE is a
	database which is created by Klusterbox when
	Klusterbox starts for the first time. About 50% of
	what Klusterbox does is reads and writes to the
	Mandates database. So by shutting down that channel
	of communication, Avast is crashing the program. To
	make sure the program can function without Avast
	shutting it down, press &ldquo;Allow App.&rdquo;</p>
<br><br>
<img src="images/help-1-0140.jpg">
<br><br>
	<p>Once you press &ldquo;Allow App&rdquo; you will get a new
	prompt informing you that Klusterbox will now be
	allowed to access the database. That&rsquo;s a good
	thing because it allows Klusterbox to operate.
	</p>
<br><br>
<img src="images/help-1-0150.jpg">
<br><br>
	<p>Go ahead and press &ldquo;Got It&rdquo; and then close
	the &ldquo;Fatal Error Detected&rdquo; prompt by
	clicking &ldquo;OK.&rdquo;</p>
	<p>Now you should be able to open Klusterbox by
	double clicking on the program.
	</p>
	<p>If you are still getting problems, try shutting
	down the anti-virus program temporary. With Avast you
	can do this with by disabling the shield control by
	right clicking on the Avast Icon in the system tray.
	The selecting &ldquo;Avast shields control&rdquo;
	then &ldquo;Disable for 10 minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<br><br>
<img src="images/help-1-0160.jpg">
<br><br>
	<p>Once the anti-virus program is disabled, then open
	Klusterbox. It should open. Once it is open you can
	turn the anti-virus program back on by following the
	same path you used to shut it off and selecting
	&ldquo;Enable all shields.&rdquo;</p>
	<p>The problem is annoying but easy to fix and once
	you&rsquo;ve got Klusterbox running, then you don&rsquo;t
	have to worry about it anymore. Clearly this is some
	sort of bug with Avast Anit-Virus. It doesn&rsquo;t
	make sense that the program is scanned, cleared and
	then prohibited from executing.</p>
	<p>If you had to work though all these steps just to
	get Klusterbox to work on your computer, then thank
	you for your patience. It&rsquo;s complex for an
	amateur like me because it&rsquo;s not my program
	that&rsquo;s crashing itself, it&rsquo;s another
	program. I&rsquo;m working to improve the program and
	I hope to iron out problems like these for the
	future.
