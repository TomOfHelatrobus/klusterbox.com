<h2>Using the Auto Over Max Finder</h2>

<p>The Auto Over Max Finder is a tool for finding violations of the
12 and 60 hour rule. For those not familiar with the rule, there is a
rule that carriers can not be made to work more than 12 hours in a
day and/or 60 hours in a week. According to the rule, auxiliary (or
CCA) do not have the 60 hour weekly limit, instead they have an 11.50
hour daily limit.
</p>
<p>There is a flaw in the Auto Over Max Finder in Klusterbox version
2.0 as it does not distinguish between OTDL and non-OTDL carriers. It
treats all carriers at OTDL carriers and only tracks violations over
12 hours, but given the speed and simplicity of the Auto Over Max
Finder, it should be a definite improvement on compiling a list of
violations manually.  Also, I&rsquo;ll be adding functionality to
Klusterbox in later version which should address this deficiency.
</p>
<h3>There Are Just Two Steps</h3>
<p><b>Step One: Open the Auto Over Max Finder</b>. Like the Auto
Improper Mandate Finder, there are two ways to open the Auto Over Max
Finder. The first way will be to press the Auto Over Max Finder
button on the main screen when the Investigation Range is not set.

<br/>

</p>
<p>The second way to open the Auto Over Max Finder will be to use the
drop down menu bar on the top of the main screen. The path is:</p>
<div align="center">Automated&gt;Auto Over Max Finder</div>
<p><img src="images/4-0020.jpg">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p><b>Step Two: Select a file containing the Employee Everything
Report</b>. Again the Employee Everything Report has to be in the csv
or xls format.  It is up to you to navigate to the folder where you
are keeping your Employee Everything Report. Once there, click on the
file. Note that you should have the Employee Everything Report for
the entire service week for the Auto Over Max Finder to work
properly.
</p>

<br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>Only files with the csv or xls format will show up on the file
dialog. However if you select on a file which is not an Employee
Everything Report, then nothing will happen. I&rsquo;ll put an error
message here when I make updates to Klusterbox 2.0.

<h3>Reading the Over Max Report</h3>
<p>The report which is generated by the Auto Over Max Finder is a
text (.txt) document which should be opened in notepad or what ever
app you have designated to open text documents.
</p>
<p>As Klusterbox generates a text document for the report, it also
names the file. The naming convention for Over Max Reports is &ldquo;max_&rdquo;
followed by the year and the pay period, all separated by an
underscore (&ldquo;_&rdquo;). Klusterbox places the file in the
&ldquo;over_max&rdquo; folder where you have placed the Klusterbox
exe file. If the &ldquo;over_max&rdquo; folder does not exist, then
Klusterbox creates it.
</p>
<p>On the first line of the report is the pay period. On the second
line of the report is the investigation range. This should show the
dates of the service week you are investigating. As always, the
beginning of the week will be a Saturday and the end of the week will
be a Friday.

</p>
<p>The report consist of 4 parts:
<table>
  <tr><td valign="top">1.</td><td>60 hour violations</td></tr>
  <tr><td valign="top">2.</td><td>12 hour full time carrier violations</td></tr>
  <tr><td valign="top">3.</td><td>11.50 hour auxiliary carrier violations</td></tr>
  <tr><td valign="top">4.</td><td>Greater of the two violations</td></tr>
</table>
</p>
<p><b>60 hour violations</b> is a list of carriers who have exceeded
the 60 hour limit for the week.  The total column shows the total
amount of hours worked in the service week and the over column shows
the hours worked in excess of the 60 hour limit. If there are no
violations, then &ldquo;no violations&rdquo; will appear under the
header.
</p>

</p>
<p><b>12 hour full time carrier violations</b> is a list of full time
carriers who have exceed 12 hours of work for the service week.  The
day column shows the day of the week when the violation occurred, the
total column shows the total hours worked on that day, the over
column shows the amount of hours worked in excess of 12 hours and the
sum shows a total for that carrier for the whole week where there
were violations of the 12 hour limit. If there are no violations,
then &ldquo;no violations&rdquo; will appear under the header.
</p>

</p>
<p><b>11.50 hour auxiliary carrier violations</b> is just like the 12
hour full time carrier violations section except it deals with
auxiliary carriers who have 11.50 hour limit.</p>
<p><img src="images/4-0070.jpg">
  <br clear="left"/>
</img>
</p>
<p><b>Greater of the two violations </b>is the final section. For
purposes of finding the appropriate remedy it is necessary to
determine which violation is greater, the daily or the weekly. The
&ldquo;greater of the two violations&rdquo; section finds the greater
violation and list it. It there is only one violation then it list
that violation. This section provides a list of what you should be
seeking a remedy for in the grievance process.
