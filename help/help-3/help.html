<h2>How To Use The Automatic Data Entry</h2>
<h3>What is Automatic Data Entry</h3>
    <p>The Automatic Data Entry feature reads the Employee Everything Report (a report available through an information
        request) and puts the data from that report, into Klusterbox's database. From there, that information can be viewed,
        edited and used to generate reports and spreadsheets. The Automatic Data Entry feature only reads files with the
        extension "csv". If you have another type of file, such as a "pdf" file, you can run the PDF Converter to transform
            your pdf into a csv.</p>
<h3>What To Expect</h3>
    <p>Once you get started, you will be asked to contribute input into the process. Since the
        Employee Everything Report doesn't know which carriers are on the otdl and other list, you will have to contribute
        that information. Another thing that the Employee Everything Report doesn't know is what are the routes on the
        strings of floaters (carrier technicians). You will have to provide that information also. Don't worry if you don't
        get all the details right, you can edit the carrier information using "edit" or the "Multi-Input" features once the
        Automatic Data Entry program has finished running. In some cases, you might choose to run it again. This is safe to
        do and will not cause any errors in the database. <br><br>The first time running the program will take more time, since
        all the carriers are new to the database and Klusterbox will need more input. Once a carrier is in Klusterbox's
        database, that carrier is remembered along with their information. You will only be prompted for input if Klusterbox
        detects a change in that information.<br><br>Once you have gone through all the screens inputting information,
        Klusterbox will ask you if you want to input the clock rings - inputting the clock rings will take a minute or so
        since all the information from the Employee Everything Report is being read and gathered in the database. There
        will be a progress bar - Please be patient.</p>
<h3>What You Need</h3>
    <p>You will need:<br><br>1. <b>An employee everything report in a csv or xls format</b>. If you only have the employee
        everything report in the pdf format, then you can use the PDF Converter it to create an employee everything
        report in cvs format. Currently, the Automatic Data Entry only works with Employee Everything Reports
        that are a week long.
<br><br>
        2. The <b>weekly schedule</b> provides a list of the routes on each of the carrier technician strings. <br><br>
        3. The <b>overtime desired list</b> and the <b>work assignment list</b>. This provides a list of names of the carriers on
the otdl and the work assignment list. Any carriers not on one of those two list is on "no list."</p>
<p>
<h3>Where to find the Automatic Data Enty</h3>
To get started, you select the "Automatic Data Entry" Option from the home page when the no date or station have been
    selected. If there is a date and station selected, you can either "reset" or select "Automatic Data Entry" from
    the "Automated" drop down menu.
</p>
    <br><br>
<img src="images/help-3-0010.jpg">
    <br><br>
<p>To select "Automatic Data Entry" from the drop down menu. First click on "Automated" and select the "Automatic
Data Entry" option. </p>
    <br><br>
<img src="images/help-3-0020.jpg">
    <br><br>
    <p>Once you open the
Automatic Data Entry, you will immediately be prompted to
select a file. Use the file dialog to navigate to the Employee
Everything Report in csv or xls format that you requested from
management. The file dialog only shows csv and xls files, so if you
got the file in the wrong format, then it won&rsquo;t show up when
you navigate to the folder where you placed it.
</p>
<br><br>
<img src="images/help-3-0030.jpg">
<br><br>
<p>Since
there are csv and xls files that are not Employee Everything Reports,
if you select a file which is not an Employee Everything Report, you
will get an error message and then be returned back to the main
screen. If this happens, make sure that the file you have is indeed
an Employee Everything Report. You can open the report in notepad or a
spreadsheet program if you are in doubt. It should read, &ldquo;TAC500R3
- Employee Everything Report&rdquo; on the first line, followed by a
whole bunch of hard to read data.
<br><br>
<p><img src="images/help-3-0040.jpg">
<br><br>
If
you don&rsquo;t get the error message and instead get the Station
Pairing Screen, then you&rsquo;ve got it made. That means that the
Automatic Data Entry can read the file that you selected and
you&rsquo;re on the way to conducting your improper mandate
investigation in a faction of the time.
</p>

<h3>Step 1. Station Pairing</h3>
<p>If the Automatic Data Entry does not recognize the name of the station in the
Employee Everything Report then the first thing that you see is the
Station Pairing screen.  If the Automatic Data Entry does
recognize the station, then you will not see the Station Pairing
screen.
</p>
<p>This screen couples
the station as it appears in the Employee Everything Report AKA TACS
(Time and Attendance Collection System) and the name you entered for
your station when you first started Klusterbox or with the List of
Stations command on the menu bar. You can use the name that comes
from TACS, but usually the name is inelegant and hard to read.
Moreover, if you have previously enter information into Klusterbox
for prior weeks,  then Klusterbox will not recognize that information
from being from the same station. That could cause problems later. So
try to match the station by pulling down the option menu under
&ldquo;Select Station:&rdquo;. Then press OK. You can select ADD
STATION to just use the name as it appears in TACS.</p>
    <br><br>
<p><img src="images/help-3-0050.jpg">
<br><br>

</p>
<p>Once you make you
selection you will be prompted with a message which informs you that
the station as it known in TACS has been paired with the station name
that you have selected and those two stations will be identified with
each other from now on. You can just press the space bar to
acknowledge this message and close it.
</p>
<p>

<br><br>
<p><img src="images/help-3-0060.jpg">
<br><br>

</p>
<h3>Step 2. Search for Name Matches #1</h3>
<p>If the Automatic Data Entry sees names that it has not seen before it will display
a list of those names. It is up to you to match the names to names
from previous investigation or to select &ldquo;NOT FOUND&rdquo; if
there is no match for the name. You can also select &ldquo;DISCARD.&rdquo;
This will remove the name from any further consideration in the
investigation process and the name will not be added to the carrier
list.
</p>
<p>This primary
function of this screen is to facilitate matching names that might
have been added manually during prior investigations. If you have not
manually entered new carriers, then you will only have the options of
&ldquo;NOT FOUND&rdquo; and &ldquo;DISCARD.&rdquo; In that case, you
should select &ldquo;NOT FOUND&rdquo; for all the names you want
included in the carrier list and press continue.
</p>
<p>If there are
possible matches for the name, you will see a number of possible
names next to the option menu. If there is a match for the name, and
you know that name to be the same person, then select it.
</p>
<br><br>
    <img src="images/help-3-0070.jpg">
><br><br>
<h3>Step 3. Search for Name Matches #2</h3>
<p>This screen does the same thing as the previous screen except it
cast the net wider in looking for names to match. This screen will
provided possible matches with carriers who are outside of the
station you are investigating. This screen will also give you a
second chance to DISCARD names.
</p>
<p>If you do not see a match for a name and you do not want to
DISCARD it, then select ADD NAME. ADD NAME is the default setting and
will add the carrier into the carrier list for the investigation.
</p>
<h3>Step 4. Input New Carriers</h3>
<p>If Automatic Data Entry sees names that it doesn&rsquo;t
have a current record for in the database and that you can&rsquo;t
match or haven&rsquo;t discarded, then it will add them into
Klusterbox as new carriers. The Automatic Data Entry should
be able to identify the carrier&rsquo;s ns day and route as long as
the carrier is not a floater. If the carrier is a floater, then you
will have to enter in the string in the route field. There is a
special format that you have to use to enter in a string. If you mess
up, you will get an error message, the screen will reload and you
will have to start again.
</p>
<p>Also, you will have to go down the list and specify who is on what
    list, i.e. otdl, wal or nl. &ldquo;nl&rdquo; means &ldquo;no list&rdquo;.</p>
<br><br>
<p><img src="images/help-3-0080.jpg">
<br><br>
<h3>Duplicate Names</h3>
<p>If you looked close at the screen shot for Step 2. you would have
seen that two of the carriers have the same name. The program needs a
special handling for cases like that because, in Klusterbox, the
carrier&rsquo;s name is a unique identifier. Klusterbox can not tell
the difference between two carriers with the exact same name and
would treat those carriers as the same person. To handle this problem
(when it comes up) the Automatic Data Entry adds the employee
id to the end of the carrier&rsquo;s name when it sees a name that an
other carrier already has.
</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like this name treatment, don&rsquo;t worry,
you will be able to change it later by clicking the edit button next
to the carrier&rsquo;s name when you get back to the main screen.
There you will have a chance to update the name to something that
suits you better. Just make sure it different from the other similar
name in the list of carriers.
</p>
<br><br>

<br><br>
<h3>Step 5. Discrepancy Resolution</h3>
<p>When the Automatic Data Entry sees that there is a
discrepancy with the information that it has coming in from the TACS
report that it is reading and the information previously entered into
Klusterbox either manually or via an earlier application of the Automatic Data Entry,
then the program will prompt you to confirm
or correct that discrepancy.
<br><br>
<img src="images/help-3-0110.jpg">
<br><br>
<h3>Step 6. Carriers No Longer At Station</h3>
<p>If Automatic Data Entry sees that a carrier from a
previous investigation is in the carrier list, but that carrier is
not mentioned in the current investigation, it will notify you of the
fact and give yo the option of placing that carrier out of station.
The &ldquo;out of station&rdquo; option in the station option menu is
a catch-all category. It can mean different things: the carrier has
transferred to a different station, the carrier quit, the carrier
retired, etc.
</p>
<br><br>
<img src="images/help-3-0120.jpg">
<br><br>

<h3>Step 7. Input Carrier Rings</h3>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the easy part. If you are ready to enter the clock
rings, then press the &ldquo;OK&rdquo; when the message box ask if yo
want to enter the clock rings. There are reasons why would might want
to hold of, like making some changes to the carrier list which you
didn&rsquo;t make earlier. That&rsquo;s okay. If you want to do it
later or not do it all, then that up to you.
</p>
<p>If you do elect to enter the clock rings, a progress bar will
appear. It will show you the Automatic Data Entry&rsquo;s
progress on entering all those clock rings in the database. Once it
done, you will be directed back to the main screen which will be set
to the investigation range that you just investigated with the Automatic Data Entry.
From there you can open Report or generate a
spreadsheet to view the results of the investigation.
