<h2>Klusterbox Download and Setup</h2>
<h3>&ldquo;Installing&rdquo; Klusterbox</h3>
<p>To get started, you first need to download Klusterbox from klusterbox.com. Please keep in mind that you don&rsquo;t have to
	install Klusterbox. There is no setup that runs on your computer and installs Klusterbox on your hard drive.
	Klusterbox is already ready to go. You will want to move it out of your Downloads folder. I put Klusterbox in a
	folder in my Documents folder, near where I keep my nalc documentation. I don&rsquo;t put it in my Program Files. I would
	advise against putting it directly on your desktop because, as the program runs, it will create new files and
	folders that will appear next to the klusterbox file. This could clutter you your desktop quick.  </p>
	<p>You might want to create a shortcut to the program
	and place it on your desktop. This is pretty simple
	on Windows. You just right click on the file and
	select &ldquo;Create Shortcut.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p>I will consider an installation program for future
	version of Klusterbox, but at present I don&rsquo;t
	know how to do it and there are some advantages to
	not having an installation program &ndash; such as
	having the ability to have multiple copies of
	Klusterbox installed on one hard drive. Actually, you
	can have as many working copies as you like.
	</p>
	<h3 class="western">Step by Step Download and Setup</h3>
	<p>1. Go to klusterbox.com. Select the Download link.</p>
	<p>2. Determine what your operating system type is.
	It will be either 32 or 64 bit. You can type system
	type or system information into the windows search
	bar and look at the System Information screen.</p>
	<p>3. Download the distribution appropriate your your
	operating system by pressing one of the big green
	buttons. If you can&rsquo;t figure out which
	operating system type you have, then use the 32 bit
	version &ndash; it will work for both operating
	system types.
	</p>
	<br><br>
	<img src="images/help-1-0010.jpg">
  	<br><br>
	<p>4.A dialog will appear. Click &ldquo;Save&rdquo; to begin
	the download.</p>
	<br><br>
	<img src="images/help-1-0020.jpg">
	<br><br>
	<p>5. (This might happen) I got this warning message
	from my McAfee anti-virus. This seems unfair. It
	&ldquo;might&rdquo; contain a virus? Go ahead and
	press &ldquo;Accept the risk.&rdquo; You can scan if
	for viruses later, before you open it, if want to
	take precautions.</p>
	<br><br>
	<img src="images/help-1-0030.jpg">
	<br><br>
  	<p>	6. Go you the download folder on your web browser. On
	the Firefox web browser it is located on the top
	right of the window. Below is a picture of what it
	looks like.</p>
	<br><br><img src="images/help-1-0040.jpg">

	<p>7. Clicking on the Download Folder Icon should give you
	a list of recently downloaded files with the most
	recent on the top. Don&rsquo;t open the file yet
	though. Remember, this is not a setup.exe, it is
	already ready to run and, for a lot of good reason,
	it is best not to open it in the downloads folder. So
	you will want to move it to a more suitable home.
	Where you put it is up to you. I recommend somewhere
	in your Documents folder. I don&rsquo;t recommend
	your Desktop, Program Files or Downloads Folder.</p>
	<p>Note: If you copy and paste the file, you can put
	copies in other places which will run independently
	of the other copies.
	</p>
	<br><br>
	<img src="images/help-1-0050.jpg">
	<br><br>
	<p>8. Create a home for you Klusterbox program. Right
	click on your Windows Explorer Icon, select
	Documents.  Then just drag the zip file from the
	Downloads folder to Documents. You can create a new
	folder or use an existing folder. Really you can put
	the zip file any where you want. You can copy and
	paste the file instead if you prefer.</p>
	<br><br>
	<img src="images/help-1-0060.jpg">
	<br><br>
<p>8 a. Once the zip file is in it&rsquo;s new
location, then click on it to open it up. You will
see one file and one folder called kb_sub (whatever
you do, do not delete the kb_sub folder and always
keep it next to the klusterbox file). Click on the
Klusterbox Application to open it.
</p>
<p> 8 b. Next press the Extract All button.
</p>
<br><br>
	<img src="images/help-1-0070.jpg">
<br><br>
	<p>8 c. A new window will appear to prompt you to provide
	a location for where the new file will be extracted.
	If you moved the file out of the out of the Downloads
	folder and into the Documents folder, then you
	shouldn&rsquo;t have to worry about changing the
	location. If you unzipped the zip file in the
	Downloads folder, you now have a chance to change the
	location with the &ldquo;Browse&rdquo; button. Finish
	the extraction by pressing &ldquo;Extract.&rdquo;</p>
<br><br>
<img src="images/help-1-0080.jpg">
<br><br>
	<p>8 d. A window will open showing you the extracted
	files. To open Klusterbox, click on the application
	&ldquo;Klusterbox.&rdquo; This is how you will open
	Klusterbox from now on. Klusterbox does not appear on
	the start menu (maybe in future versions, but not
	now). The kb_sub folder contains files that
	Klusterbox needs to work properly. Make sure to not
	delete it and to keep it in the same folder as the
	Klusterbox app to ensure the program works correctly.</p>
<br><br>
<img src="images/help-1-0090.jpg">
<br><br>
	<p>8 e. <b>Create a shortcut: </b>If
	you want to make accessing Klusterbox a little easier
	by creating a shortcut, then right click on the
	Klusterbox file. Select &ldquo;Create Shortcut&rdquo;
	on the menu. This will create a shortcut that you can
	drag to your Desktop for easy access.
	</p>
	<p>9. (Optional) If you want to be sure that the
	program doesn&rsquo;t contain a virus, visit
	<a href="http://www.virustotal.com/">www.virustotal.com</a>
	and upload the Klusterbox file. The site scans
	whatever is uploaded to it with all the commercially
	available antivirus software programs. Klusterbox
	version 2 comes up clean in 70 different anti-virus
	programs &ndash; except for one false positive (just
	my luck) from an anti-virus I&rsquo;ve never heard of
	Jiangmin
	which doesn&rsquo;t respond when you report false
	positives.</p>
	<p>If you have an anti-virus installed on your
	computer (I have Avast), you can right click on the
	klusterbox file and select &ldquo;Scan selected items
	for viruses.&rdquo; Even if you don&rsquo;t take this
	step, the anti-virus should scan any executable file
	the first time you start it anyway.
	</p>
	<p>10. Since this is the first time starting this
	program and because Windows doesn&rsquo;t know that
	Klusterbox exist, you will get a warning from
	Windows.</p>
<br><br>
<img src="images/help-1-0100.jpg">
<br><br>
	<p>
	If you get this prompt, click on the &ldquo;More info&rdquo;
	link. Only after that will you get the option to &ldquo;Run
	Anyway.&rdquo; Please press, &ldquo;Run Anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<br><br>
<img src="images/help-1-0110.jpg">
<br><br>
	<p>11. Klusterbox should now open unless you have issues
	with Anti-Viruses. It that happens, see the section
	below called Anti-Virus Programs.
	</p>
	<a name="antivirus_problems"></a>
	<h3>Anti-Virus Program Problems</h3>
	<p>There might be an issue with anti-virus programs.
	This was an issue with Klusterbox version 1.0, but
	not too much of a problem. I have Avast Anti-Virus.
	So the following will detail the conflicts that Avast
	has with Klusterbox and will show how to get things
	working properly. I don&rsquo;t know how other
	anti-virus programs are going to interact with
	Klusterbox, but hopefully, this description will give
	you an idea of how to handle them.
	</p>
	<p>First, the anti-virus program scans Klusterbox as
	the program is trying to open.
	</p>
<br><br>
<img src="images/help-1-0120.jpg">
<br><br>
	<p>Once the scan is completed, a message will appear stating
	that no viruses were found. This appeared and
	disappeared before I could get a screen shot of it.
	</p>
	<p>The next thing to happen is a prompt appears with
	an error message and Klusterbox shuts down. This
	looks pretty grim.
	</p>
<br><br>
<img src="images/help-1-0130.jpg">
<br><br>>
	<p>Immediately after that another prompt from Avast stating that
	Avast has stopped Klusterbox from writing to a
	document called Mandates.SQLITE. Mandates.SQLITE is a
	database which is created by Klusterbox when
	Klusterbox starts for the first time. About 50% of
	what Klusterbox does is reads and writes to the
	Mandates database. So by shutting down that channel
	of communication, Avast is crashing the program. To
	make sure the program can function without Avast
	shutting it down, press &ldquo;Allow App.&rdquo;</p>
<br><br>
<img src="images/help-1-0140.jpg">
<br><br>
	<p>Once you press &ldquo;Allow App&rdquo; you will get a new
	prompt informing you that Klusterbox will now be
	allowed to access the database. That&rsquo;s a good
	thing because it allows Klusterbox to operate.
	</p>
<br><br>
<img src="images/help-1-0150.jpg">
<br><br>
	<p>Go ahead and press &ldquo;Got It&rdquo; and then close
	the &ldquo;Fatal Error Detected&rdquo; prompt by
	clicking &ldquo;OK.&rdquo;</p>
	<p>Now you should be able to open Klusterbox by
	double clicking on the program.
	</p>
	<p>If you are still getting problems, try shutting
	down the anti-virus program temporary. With Avast you
	can do this with by disabling the shield control by
	right clicking on the Avast Icon in the system tray.
	The selecting &ldquo;Avast shields control&rdquo;
	then &ldquo;Disable for 10 minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<br><br>
<img src="images/help-1-0160.jpg">
<br><br>
	<p>Once the anti-virus program is disabled, then open
	Klusterbox. It should open. Once it is open you can
	turn the anti-virus program back on by following the
	same path you used to shut it off and selecting
	&ldquo;Enable all shields.&rdquo;</p>
	<p>The problem is annoying but easy to fix and once
	you&rsquo;ve got Klusterbox running, then you don&rsquo;t
	have to worry about it anymore. Clearly this is some
	sort of bug with Avast Anit-Virus. It doesn&rsquo;t
	make sense that the program is scanned, cleared and
	then prohibited from executing.</p>
	<p>If you had to work though all these steps just to
	get Klusterbox to work on your computer, then thank
	you for your patience. It&rsquo;s complex for an
	amateur like me because it&rsquo;s not my program
	that&rsquo;s crashing itself, it&rsquo;s another
	program. I&rsquo;m working to improve the program and
	I hope to iron out problems like these for the
	future.
