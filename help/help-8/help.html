<h2>Updating to a New Version</h2>
<h3>How to Update Without Losing Information</h3>
    <p>Klusterbox is an application that does not appear in the program files and as of now, I don't have the expertise to
        write a program that will put it there and apply automatic updates. Fortunately, updating the program to the newest
        version is easy.</p>

    <p>1. Go to klusterbox.com/download to see if you have the most recent version.</p>

    <p>2. You can tell which version of klusterbox you have currently by running klusterbox and going to
        Management > About Klusterbox on the menu bar.

    <br/></p>
    <p>3. If you don't have the most recent version, then proceed to download the most recent version from the download page
    at klustebox.com/download. The steps are nearly the same as those laid out in
    <a href="../help-1/help.html">Downloading and Setting up Klusterbox</a> with some differences.
    <p>4. Download the distribution appropriate your your operating system by pressing one of the big green buttons.</p>
    </p>

    <br/></p>
    <p>5. A dialog will appear. Click Save to begin the download.</p>
    <p><img src="images/8-0030.jpg">
    <br clear="left"/>
    </img>
    <br/></p>
    <p>6. Go you the download folder on your web browser. On the Firefox web browser it is located on the top right
        of the window. Below is a picture of what it looks like.</p>
    <p><img src="images/8-0040.jpg">
    <br clear="left"/>
    </img>
    <br/></p>
    <p>7. Clicking on the Download Folder Icon should give you a list of recently downloaded files with the most recent
        on the top. Open the downloads folder for the browser so that you can see the recently downloaded .zip folder.</p>
    <p><img src="images/8-0050.jpg">
    <br clear="left"/>
    </img>
    <br/></p>
    <p>8. Here the process differs from the original set up. You will upzip the folder while it is still in the
        downloads folder. </p>
    <p><img src="images/8-0060.jpg">
    <br clear="left"/>
    </img>
    <br/></p>
    <p>9. When the zip file unzips, you will see a folder with an executable file, klusterbox.exe and another folder
        callled kb_sub.</p>
    <p><img src="images/8-0070.jpg">
    <br clear="left"/>
    </img>
    <br/></p>
    <p>10. Without closing the window with the upzipped folder, open a new window and navigate to the folder where you keep
        klusterbox. This should contain the klusterbox.exe (or some version of it) and the kb_sub folder. This is the
        version of klusterbox with all the information in it which you want to preserve. </p>
    <p><img src="images/8-0080.jpg">
    <br clear="left"/>
    </img>
    <br/></p>
    <p>11. Simply drag and drop the newer version of the klusterbox.exe from the upzipped folder in downloads, to the folder
        where your older version of klusterbox was kept. If the two versions have the same name, you can overwrite and
        replace the old version. If the two versions have different names, there should be no conflict. </p>
    <p><img src="images/8-0090.jpg">
    <br clear="left"/>
    </img>
    <br/></p>
    <p>12. You're done! Go ahead and click on the new klusterbox version to open it. It should open to the main screen,
    skipping the start up screen. You should be able to see your stations in the drop down menu at the top of the
        screen.</p>
    <p>13. You can ignore the kb_sub folder which is still in the downloads folder or you can delete it. DO NOT
    delete the kb_sub folder which you have been using, it contains all your carrier and clock rings information.</p>
    <p>It is fine to have a newer and an older version of the Klusterbox app sitting together in the same folder. I'm
    not sure it would be a good idea to run them both at the same time, but running them separately should be fine. </p>
    <p> You can create a short cut for your desk top if you want as is laid out in
    <a href="../help-1/help.html">Downloading and Setting up Klusterbox</a></p>

<h3>How it works</h3>
    <p>When Klusterbox opens up, it looks for a database which is located in the kb_sub folder. If that database, called
    mandates.sqlite, does not exist, the Klusterbox program creates it. If it does already exist, the Klusterbox
        program reads it. The kb_sub folder has to be
    in the same directory/folder as the klusterbox.exe app to work. 90% of what Klusterbox does is to read and write
        to this mandates.sqlite database. </p>
    <p><img src="images/8-0100.jpg">
    <br clear="left"/>
    </img>
    <br/></p>
    <p>You can even view the database if you like with apps you can get free online. I
        use DB Browser (SQLite). Be careful though. You can seriously screw up the database if you start making changes.
        DO NOT try to use a database browser to enter data directly into the database. The improperly formatted data
        will screw up the database and could cause Klusterbox to crash.</p>
    <p><img src="images/8-0110.jpg">
    <br clear="left"/>
    </img>
    <br/></p>
    <p>The database MUST be in the kb_sub folder and the kb_sub folder MUST be in the
    same folder as the Klusterbox.exe file. Also, the database must be called "mandates.sqlite". </p>
    <p>So really, this database "mandates.sqlite" is what contains all the information you have inputted using
    Klusterbox. You can move it to any other computer and put inside a folder called kb_sub and then put that next to
    any Klusterbox program and you will have access to your carrier information and clock rings. There are some folders
    that also get generated and live in the kb_sub folder which make up the archives, but these aren't as important
    since you can just regenerate them using the Klusterbox.exe and the Mandates.sqlite database. </p>
