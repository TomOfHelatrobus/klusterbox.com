        <td width="600"><p>I recorded and posted some tutorials on youTube. These tutorials should give you a quick overview and
        explain how to use Klusterbox. I'm going to be working on a text document which will give written step by step
        instructions, but that will probably take a while to finish. So in the meantime, be sure to watch the videos
        if you have any questions. </p>
        <p>All of these video were made with Klusterbox version 1.0. So the user interface might look different in
        parts. That doesn't matter though. The functionality will be the same. The automated features are not covered.
         Stay tuned for those tutorials. </p></td>

        Klusterbox can read. </td>
