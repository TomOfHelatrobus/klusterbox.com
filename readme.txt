Klusterbox Version 3.0 Is Here!

I released version 1.0 of this program in October of 2018 and since then I've been working on completely automating the data entry aspect of the program. Version 2.0 of Klusterbox aided the union steward in improper mandate investigations as well investigations of violations of the 12/60 hour limit. The automated features of version 2.0 made the process much, much faster. Investigations which once took over two hours, now take 5 minutes. Version 3.0 introduced the pdf reader, which allows stewards to do more investigating with less information. With just a weekly employee everything report, you now have access to a wealth of investigative tools and reports.
What is Klusterbox?
  	● 	Klusterbox is a tool for investigating article 8 grievances and was developed by a NALC union steward.
  	● 	Klusterbox is a computer program available for Windows (other platforms will be available later).
  	● 	Klusterbox is free to download and use.
  	● 	Development is ongoing. More features and functionality are on the way.
Klusterbox Features:
  	● 	Build list of carriers. Revise, update and change the list from week to week as needed. Klusterbox keeps track of who's on the OTDL, ns/days, who's on which route and what station they're at.
  	● 	Data entry screens allow for easy entry of clock rings. Klusterbox comes with multiple move functionality - record whenever carriers move off their routes, even when when they do it multiple times in a day.
  	● 	Don't know what color ns/day correlates to which day of the week? No problem, Klusterbox matches the color ns/day code to the correct day on in any given service week.
  	● 	Choose between investigating just one day or an entire service week with the investigation range feature.
  	● 	Klusterbox can be used at the branch level to conduct investigations for multiple stations
  	● 	Use codes to keep track of notable cases like when OTDL carriers call in sick or when non-list carriers are mandated to work on their ns/days.
  	● 	View the results of the investigation in reports or generate a spreadsheet which you can print. The spreadsheets contain all the necessary formulas allowing you to update them outside of Klusterbox.
  	● 	Utilize tolerances to cut down on the clutter and ignore negligible violations. Adjust the tolerances to suit your preferances or turn them off altogether.
  	● 	Automated features such as Automatic Data Entry allow you to speed up the process. Do a two hour investigation in less than five minutes.
  	● 	Find violations of the 12/60 hour rule with the Automatic Over Max Finder and generate a report with just a few mouse clicks.
  	● 	Generate a report for pay periods for any year you want. The report gives you the pay period, start and end date. Klusterbox stamps your spreadsheets and reports with the correct pay period. Don't be inconvenienced again.
  	● 	Keep track of which settlements have been paid and which haven't been paid wirh Informal C, a tool which tracks what management owes, down the the individual carrier.
  	● 	Past versions of Klusterbox depended upon the employee everything report in the csv format, but the new PDF Converter allows access to the suite of Klusterbox functionality with just an employee everything report in pdf format. This makes your information request easier and less complicated.
